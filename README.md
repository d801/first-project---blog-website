# first-project---blog-website
This is a blog website with css and html 
The project couldn't be uploaded to github due to the high resolution of images and that the extension is JPG not PNG .
so I had to resize the images by reducing the pixels and change the extension to png for the whole project to get uploaded. 
here is a link for the project with images with high resolution https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bBYf87aI7u_UlEZbfRdOaBYcrGwZspIv
