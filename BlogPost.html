				<h2>What i've come to learn about love</h2>
				<article>
				<p>
					What does it mean to really love someone? This question has plagued me my entire life — or at least until recently. 
					I've noticed that I have regular behavior. whenever someone tries to get close to me, I ran and end things quickly. I don't know when did I develop such behavior but I don't like it at all. To put it succinctly,  I’ve made a mess of the word love and everything it entails. I know I’m not alone in saying I fell victim to my own destructive behaviors. I didn’t know how to risk my heart, my well-being, my dreams and life for something that could break my heart.
					</p><p> Over time, I grew numb to my behavior. However, recently I'm trying to change and I think I have a feeling for someone or I don't know I can't tell honestly. But what I'm sure of is I like it when he is around. His silly laugh and stupid jokes. the sad part of the story is he is preparing to leave for another place. I don't know how to handle him being gone and I know I'm going to miss him. But there is a silver lining in the story here.
					</p><p>
					1- I’ve learned that you can see inside someone’s soul, into their heart and all of the beauty of who they are, and actually love them with their flaws, vulnerabilities, and shortcomings — as well as your own. Our flaws make us who we are, they are what make us lovable and able to love the people with whom we choose to share our lives. I think it’s important to see beyond the surface, to step out of our own shoes and into the shoes of others and to let their intentions be the true source of our understanding of them.
				</p><p>
					2-I’ve learned that love isn’t about yourself and looking to meet one’s own needs, but rather the willingness to put someone else’s needs, happiness and well-being above your own. It’s the desire and intention of one’s heart that wants for this other human being to be happy loved and appreciated at all costs and turning over every stone in the process until you get there.
				</p><p>
					3-I’ve learned that love is fucking scary. Really scary. I thought I knew what that meant, but it wasn’t until I was truly able to love someone that I really understood this — it’s taken me most of my life.
				</p><p>
					I'm making my amends for all who loved me and I didn't love them back. I know I'll overcome this and be okay. I hope in a couple of years from now I look back and thank god that I found love, Understood the thing I sought through my life. That I would have the feeling of being complete like Zima blue in love, death, and robots <q>"And as I do, I will slowly shut down my higher brain functions un-making myself leaving just enough to appreciate my surroundings to extract some simple pleasure from the execution of a task well done."</q>.funny how I quote a robot feeling.
